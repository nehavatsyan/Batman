		            <h2>The One Man War On Crime</h2>
			        <p>
			   Although Batman now has a family of sorts comprised of Robin, Red Robin and
			   Nightwing, among others, his origin as a one-man war on crime is perhaps one of the
			   most endearing aspects of his character. if you've ever been a victim of a criminal, then
			   you'll be familiar with the sense of rageful injustice that comes hand in hand. Bruce 
			   Wayne, as early as 8 years old, had suffered this injustice to such an extreme that he
			   chose to arm himself with every weapon posiible and suit up to take back the treets,
			   one lowlife at a time.

		        <h2>The Bat Cave</h2>
			    <p>
			  it houses literally the entire Bat-legacy from Batsuits to Batmobiles, as well as trophies
			  of victory and oh, who could forget, a gaint T-Rex statue in fact the Batcave is
			  conceptually similar to Bruce Wayne himself in many ways, where there once was a
			  dark,endless void deep beneath the surface now  resides the Batman. There are plenty
			  of physical and metaphorical barriers that he places around himself amd his secret
			  identity, but the Batcave is by far the most awesome.
